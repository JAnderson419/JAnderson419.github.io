        With the historic investment in semiconductors brought about by the CHIPS and Science Act, the SIA has <a href='https://www.semiconductors.org/chipping-away-assessing-and-addressing-the-labor-market-gap-facing-the-u-s-semiconductor-industry/'>projected</a> a significant labor market gap. This is especially important in Vermont, where GlobalFoundries has been developing <a href='https://gf.com/gf-press-release/globalfoundries-awarded-35-million-funding-from-u-s-government-to-accelerate-manufacturing-of-next-generation-gan-chips/'>GaN-on-Si</a> technology to enable low-cost, high-efficiency power and RF devices for a connected, electrified future. As Vermont's land-grant instutution comitted to supporting the local high-tech workforce and enabling a thiving future for people and planet, UVM has embarked on a focused effort to grow capability in semiconductor education.

This project is ongoing and has established both graduate and undergraduate certificates in semiconductor engineering and physics. In doing so, new laboratory facilities for on-wafer characterization, IC deprocessing, and fabrication have been established and utilized in hands-on labs for IC fabrication and device physics courses. When not in use for teaching, these labs serve dual purpose as resources to support graduate research, furthering semiconductor innovation in Vermont.
