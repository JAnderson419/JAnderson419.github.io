MEMS resonators are widely used in commercial RF products due to their high quality factor, providing higher performance products than would be achievable by purely electronic (LC) circuits. The growing desire for wireless data has necessitated a move to higher frequencies where bandwidth is more plentiful, however electrical signals at these frequencies also experience greater losses when traveling long distances. This creates a strong motivation for moving MEMS and the logic from the current state, where they are processed seperately and packaged near each other, towards a more integrated approach. Beyond traditional RF applications, interest is also growing in mechanical resonators for novel applications such as resonant power converters for compact, high efficiency DC-DC conversion and 2D material-based resonators for sensing and analog computing. MEMS integration enables all of these and more.
