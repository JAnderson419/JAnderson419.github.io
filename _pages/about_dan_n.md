#### BS Student, Electrical Engineering
##### January 2025-May 2025

Daniel Nalepa is an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering at the University of Vermont, with a concentration in semiconductor devices through the Undergraduate Certificate in Semiconductor Engineering and Physics (UCSEP) program. His current research is focused on the characterization of ferroelectric materials for use in non-volatile memory applications such as FeRAM. Daniel has been investigating polarization hysteresis behavior of potential ferroelectric devices using a Keithley 4200 Parametric Analyzer. His work on this area has contributed to the validation of testing methods for future custom ferroelectric devices using UVM's new deposition tool.
