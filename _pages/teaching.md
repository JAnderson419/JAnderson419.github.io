### Semiconductor Materials and Devices 
##### EE 3440/5440, PHYS 3675/5675
###### Spring 2024
This course offers a brief introduction to quantum mechanics, density of states, and statistical mechanics as they relate to solid state device theory. Equilibrium and non-equilibrium behaviour of carriers (generation, recombination, drift, diffusion) are covered and applied to derive behaviour of semiconductor devices including pn junctions, MS contacts (ohmic and Schottky), MOS capacitors, field effect transistors, and bipolar junction transistors. Assumptions behind "ideal" device models are discussed as well as non-idealities and small-signal model extraction. Theoretical lecture is paired with a laboratory where students are introduced to on-wafer probing of devices utilizing IV and CV techniques, as well as materials characterization through four point probe and hall effect measurements.
