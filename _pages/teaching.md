### Semiconductor Materials and Devices 
##### EE 3440/5440, PHYS 3675/5675
###### Spring 2024, 2025
This course offers an introduction to quantum mechanics, density of states, and statistical mechanics as they relate to solid state device theory. Equilibrium and non-equilibrium behaviour of carriers (generation, recombination, drift, diffusion) are covered and applied to derive behaviour of semiconductor devices including pn junctions, MS contacts (ohmic and Schottky), MOS capacitors, field effect transistors, and bipolar junction transistors. Assumptions behind "ideal" device models are discussed as well as non-idealities and small-signal model extraction. Theoretical lecture is paired with a laboratory where students are introduced to on-wafer probing of devices utilizing IV and CV techniques, as well as materials characterization through four point probe and hall effect measurements.

### Integrated Circuit Fabrication
##### EE 3420/5460, PHYS 3165/5165
###### Fall 2024, 2025
An introductory course that covers the motivation behind CMOS processing and the unit processes that are carried out during fabrication. Topics include: static CMOS logic, crystallography/substrate fabrication, optics and photolithography, wet/dry etching and cleaning, PVD/CVD techniques and oxide growth, solid source and ion implant doping, Fick's laws of diffusion, thermal processing, and BEOL integration. Theoretical lecture is paired with a laboratory where students deprocess integrated circuits for physical analysis, design a test mask, characterize and optimize photolithography/etching processes to fabricate their design, and utilize TCAD software to model a PMOS process flow.
