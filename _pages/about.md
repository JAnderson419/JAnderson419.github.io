Jackson Anderson received his BS ('15) and MS ('17) in microelectronic engineering from the Rochester Institute of Technology and his PhD ('23) in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University. He has interned in the areas of in-line test, yield analysis, and manufacturing technology (data analytics) at Globalfoundries/IBM Microelectronics. He joined UVM in 2023, where he helped establish laboratories for microelectronics teaching and research as part of a Department of Education effort to close the growing workforce gap in the semiconductor industry. His research interests lie in the area of piezo and ferroelectric materials characterization, how these materials can be integrated into electrical and mechanical devices, and how these devices can be integrated in commercial fabrication processes to enable new functionality and increased efficiency in circuits.
